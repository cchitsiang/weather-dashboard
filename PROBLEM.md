# Weather Dashboard Exercise:

Build a small web application ( using javascript technology such as nodejs, Angular etc.) that performs the following
1. Create a responsive dashboard ( available on mobile and desktop) using any template engine of your choice to create a weather dashboard

2. The dashboard must contain the following
* Real-time dashboard that automatically updates weather for the current location ( Name of the place and current temperature)
o Use any 3rd party API such as weather underground ( use the free tier )
* Display the current weather exactly “half-way” around the world from your current location
* Even if the API is unavailable ( limit reached for the free usage of the API:) OR the API is experiencing errors ) , the last generated weather update should be displayed on the dashboard

3. Build the project using your favourite nodejs build tool and deploy using docker containers ( using images of your choice)
* Build should include automated unit-test cases ( for the backend )

## Output :
* Send your output and source code ( github repo) in no more than 36 hours

## Rules:
* Use the internet for reference perspective
* Use your choice of libraries and open source components
* Use only the free tier of your favorite weather API
* Code must compile and execute
